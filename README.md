# computer-graphics

For this final year project, we built a 3D graphics engine from scratch, capable of simulating lighting, animation, reflections, raytracing, custom materials, transparency and real time rasterization.

We submitted our code alongside a short 3D animation generated by the code, and recieved a strong 1st.
