# Indicative marking features

The list below aims to provide an indication of the kinds of features required for each degree classification.
The final grade awarded will depend upon the exact combination and features and how well they have been implemented.


### In order to pass the unit (40s) you must implement ALL of…
* ~~OBJ loading (geometry and materials)~~
* ~~Wireframe rendering~~
* ~~Flat shaded rasterising~~
* ~~Moving camera (position only)~~
* Saving of PPM files

### To get into 50s you must ALSO implement SOME of…
* ~~Changing camera orientation (via orientation matrix)~~
* ~~LookAt~~
* ~~Hard Shadow~~
* Some form of generative geometry
* ~~Ambient lighting~~
* ~~Diffuse lighting (proximity and angle-of-incidence)~~

### To get into 60s you must ALSO implement SOME of…
* Gouraud shading
* Naive (non-perspective corrected) texture mapping
* Simple animation (e.g. fly-through)
* Some form of Physics (gravity, friction, bounce etc)
* Basic culling (far-plane, near-plan, back-face)
* ~~Basic anti-aliasing~~(quincux)

### To get into 70s you must ALSO implement SOME of…
* Phong Shading
* Fairly “interesting” materials (e.g. mirrors)
* Complex anti-aliasing
* Perspective corrected texture mapping
* “Fancy” animation
* ~~Soft shadow~~
* Bump maps
* Environment maps
* Basic clipping (bounding box)

### To get 80 and above you must ALSO implement SOME of…
* Complex “interesting” materials (e.g. glass)
* Line drawing optimisations (e.g. Bresenham)
* Advance clipping (frustum)
* Photon maps and caustics
* “Intelligent” model simplification

NOTE: Limited help/assistance will be available for theses 80’s topics
(You need to demonstrate your own capabilities !)
